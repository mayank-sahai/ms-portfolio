# My Portfolio

## Purpose
My portfolio serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. It's designed to provide visitors with insights into my capabilities and the projects I've worked on.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured organization with separate folders for different purposes:
- `src/`
  - `assets/`: Contains images, fonts, or any other static assets used in the project.
  - `components/`: Houses reusable React components used across the application.

## Special Features
While the portfolio is currently in progress, here are some planned features:
- Utilization of animations to enhance user experience.
- Possible integration of APIs for dynamic content (optional).
